- When developing I'm running the frontend and backend with hot reload so just make changes to the code and I can see if those changes worked or not
- Read docs/PRD.md to get a high-level understanding of the app / project
- Don't put dart or python code in other files. Stick to the main.dart and main.py
- Don't worry about unit tests or integration tests for now
