## RULES

- When developing I'm running the frontend and backend with hot reload so just make changes to the code and I can see if those changes worked or not
- Read docs/PRD.md to get a high-level understanding of the app / project
- Read docs/DB_schema.md to learn about the database design
- When implementing a new feature or starting a new session it is a good idea to first read docs/PRD.md and docs/DB_schema.md to know the product and the database architecture
- Don't put dart or python code in other files. Stick to the main.dart and main.py
- Don't worry about unit tests or integration tests for now

## COMMANDS

- The pre-commit is already setup. Simply run `pre-commit run -a`
