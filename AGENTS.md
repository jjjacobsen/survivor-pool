# Memory for AI Agents

## RULES

- When developing I'm running the frontend and backend with hot reload so just make changes to the code and I can see if those changes worked or not
- Read docs/PRD.md to get a high-level understanding of the app / project
- Read docs/DB_schema.md to learn about the database design
- Read db/init.js to know the real structure of static DB data, specifically the seasons collection
- When implementing a new feature or starting a new session it is a good idea to first read docs/PRD.md, docs/DB_schema.md, and db/init.js to know the product and the database architecture
- Don't worry about unit tests or integration tests for now
- Don't use SnackBar's in flutter
- If you need to run python commands in the backend, use uv

## COMMANDS

- When the prompt is simply "pre-commit" I would like you to run the following command:
  - `pre-commit run -a`
  - If there are failures, iterate until it passes
