Draft your Survivor picks each week, track live eliminations, and battle friends to be the last player standing. Fresh season data drops right after each episode

## Description

Build your Survivor pool, submit a weekly no-repeat pick, and see who can outlast the tribe. Survivor Pool keeps the game simple: pick a contestant you believe will survive the week, avoid repeats, and watch the leaderboard adjust as eliminations happen

What you can do:

- Create or join pools with friends and family
- Browse the full season roster with tribe and elimination history
- Submit and edit weekly picks before the deadline
- Track live standings with remaining pick counts per player
- Review your pick history and see how far each contestant made it
- Run multiple pools at once using the same season data

Built for mobile with a clean, fast experience that keeps results in sync. Season data is pulled from TV canon so every elimination matches what aired. Survivor Pool is a fan-made companion and is not affiliated with CBS or Survivor
